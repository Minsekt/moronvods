since my a/b motor mounts are MJF single pieces i needed a way to add umbilical compatibility without the need to reprint anything. so i designed this.
its however heavily based on [Selliot79's Design](https://github.com/selliott79/Voron-V2-Umbilical-Mounts/). i just designed it to be a bit smaller, to fit a IGUS CF5.05.18 perfectly and moved the mountings to the rear, so theres space for a [Y Endstop relocation](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/tree/main/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation)
