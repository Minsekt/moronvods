# Rear Umbilical Addon

![umbilical](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/blob/main/Rear_Umbilical/rear_umbilical.png)

since my a/b motor mounts are MJF single pieces i needed a way to add umbilical compatibility without the need to reprint anything. so i designed this.
its however heavily based on Selliot79's Design. i just designed it to be a bit smaller, to fit a IGUS CF5.05.18 perfectly and moved the mountings to the rear, so theres space for a [Y Endstop relocation](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/tree/main/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation) 

| BOM | Pieces |
| ------ | ------ |
| M3 Heatinsert | 4x |
| M3x10 SCHS | 4x |

(this picture was still WIP and does not represent the final version (only design changes to the front)
