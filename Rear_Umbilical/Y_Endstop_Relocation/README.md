# Y Endstop Relocation.

![rear](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/blob/main/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation/endstop.png)

Once youll go Umbilical you need to relocate your Y Endstop.
my whole build ist printed in single-piece MJF's, so i did not want to reprint everything. 

figured im not alone with the last, so i designed this one.
Its position is the same as Hartk1213's Y endstop relocation but with the possibility to adjust it. 

BOM: 
2x M3x35MM (Stock are M3x30MM)
