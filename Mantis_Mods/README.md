#  Mantis Mods

This is a Collection of Mantis Mods im currently working on.
I Loved the Stealthburners Nozzle Leds so much that i had to model something like it for the Mantis too as i really was missing seeing my first layers perfecly without pointing a flashlight at it.

The Umbilical PCB Mount is only tested with the regular version of the PCB, the ERCF version is not tested (but should work)

i use a [IGUS CF5.05.18](https://www.igus.de/product/CF5?artnr=CF5.05.18) for my Umbilical Mod.

Its a 18 Core cable, 14 for the PCB, 3 for the LEDS and 1 for Filament Sensor SNG (i steal GND from XES on the PCB)

Theres a Molex Sidemount you can see in the Pictures which you can find on my repo [here](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/tree/main/LGX_LITE_MODS)

You might find some other interesting and useful mods on [my repo](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/).

Cheers!
